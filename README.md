### Performance Study of DVB-T2 System over Fading Channels

MATLAB programs are created to simulate digital signal transmission with various M-QAM modulation schemes. I take consideration of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), Rayleigh and Rician fading channels and examine the bit-error-rate (BER) versus energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio (Eb/N0) correlation. The effect of varying rotating angles is also taken into account for both frequency-flat and frequency-selective fading conditions.
